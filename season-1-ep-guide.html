						<h3>"Abolition of the Club!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui Hirasawa has just started her high school life, but does not know if she should join a club or not. Ritsu Tainaka wants to reform the light music club, which will be disbanded by the end of April if at least four members cannot be found. Ritsu convinces her friend Mio Akiyama to join the light music club instead of the literature club. Tsumugi Kotobuki, originally intending to join the choir club, also agrees to join. In their search for a fourth member, the three put up a poster for the club which catches Yui's eye. Misunderstanding the term 'light music', Yui submits a form only to realize they are looking for someone to play a guitar, which she cannot play. Despite this, the three members try to get Yui to stay, and after playing a short piece for her, Yui decides joins the club and learn the guitar, which she first has to buy.</p><br>

						<h3>"Instruments"</h3><br>
						<p>The light music club members help Yui purchase a guitar. With a ¥50,000 advance on her allowance, Yui goes to a music store where an expensive Gibson Les Paul catches her eye, though its cost is beyond what she can afford at ¥250,000. In order to make enough money, the girls decide to get part-time jobs and end up being traffic survey counters. After two days, and getting paid only ¥8,000 per day, they are still not even close to purchasing the guitar. However, Yui tells the others to keep their hard earned money, and that she will settle for a cheaper guitar. However, when the girls return to the music store, Yui is still drawn to the Gibson Les Paul. On the verge of returning to part-time jobs to earn more money, Tsumugi haggles with the shopkeeper for a discount on the guitar. He immediately recognizes her as the daughter of the company's president and he quickly offers the guitar for ¥50,000.</p><br>

						<h3>"Special Training!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui and the girls are now taking their midterms. Unfortunately, Yui practices playing her guitar chords instead of studying, and she fails the exams. If she fails the retest, she cannot participate in club activities, and the club will be disbanded due to lack of members. A day before the retest, Yui still has not been able to study much and begs Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi to help her; Mio comes through, while Ritsu is more hinderance than help. Days after the retest, an exhausted Yui returns to the club room with perfect marks. To celebrate, the girls ask Yui to play the guitar chords she had learned, only to find that Yui has completely forgotten them.</p><br>

						<h3>"Training Camp!"</h3><br>
						<p>Mio finds a box filled with stuff from the previous light music club, including a cassette tape of the previous club's performance at the school festival. After listening to it, Mio is inspired to get the gang together to practice over the summer break for the upcoming school festival. Worried about cost, the girls turn to Tsumugi, who just so happens to have a villa along the coast. They travel to Tsumugi's beachside villa, where Mio is determined to practice; outnumbered, Mio and the girls end up playing around instead. After eventually getting some practice done in the evening, Mio is awed by the sight of Yui playing guitar in front of some fireworks. Mio confesses to the others that she wants them to be as good as the old light music club, playing the cassette tape for them. However, when tape flips to the B-side, Mio is horrified by the shrieking intro of a vocalist in the old club. To cheer Mio up, Yui plays a perfect guitar solo and learns a new trick of vibrato on the guitar.</p><br>

						<h3>"Mentor!"</h3><br>
						<p>The light music club is still not officially recognized, as they did not turn in a club form months before and have yet to find an adviser. The girls ask the music teacher Sawako Yamanaka to be their adviser. Though she initially refuses, it is discovered that she used to be a member of the previous light music club, and was into death metal, and Ritsu uses that fact to blackmail her into becoming the adviser. As the club still needs a vocalist and lyrics, Mio writes a song called "Light and Fluffy Time", which - despite protests from Ritsu - is accepted. Since Mio is too embarrassed to sing, Yui offers instead, but she cannot sing and play guitar simultaneously. Sawako teaches her to do so, but after all the training, she loses her voice. With only three days left to the school festival, Mio must perform the vocals herself.</p><br>

						<p>On the day of the school festival, an anxious Mio wants to practice for the club's live event, but everyone else is obligated helping with their classes' other stands. They later get some practice done, but Mio is still nervous about singing center stage, with Sawako's costume choices not helping her mood. Ritsu holds a mock concert introduction to calm Mio's nerves. Although she still has jitters when the concert starts, the others encourage Mio to do her best, having seen practicing diligently beforehand. The show manages to be a success! However, leaving the stage Mio trips over the guitar cable and accidentally exposes her underwear to the audience. She ends up getting a fan club, but is traumatized by her embarrassment.</p><br>

						<h3>"Christmas!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui's sister Ui Hirasawa remembers how Yui once attempted to give her a white Christmas when they were little, by putting pillow-stuffing on the tree outside. Ritsu decides to hold a Christmas party for the club, and while her initial plans of holding it at Tsumugi's house fail, they eventually decide to have it at Yui's house while Yui's parents are on vacation. Yui's friend Nodoka Manabe also gets an invitation. The girls decide to hold a gift exchange at the party, and go shopping for various gifts. Ui prepares a lovely Christmas dinner for the group, which gets a little out of hand when Sawako shows up out of nowhere. After the gift exchange, Yui and Ui end up giving each other just the right warm accessories for the winter. After the rest of the group leaves, snow falls and Yui and Ui decide to sleep together; unfortunately for Ui, Yui ends up hogging the sheets. In the New Year, the club decides to go to the shrine to make their New Year wishes.</p><br>

						<h3>"Freshman Reception!"</h3><br>
						<p>Ui enters Yui's school as a freshman, as well as her classmate Azusa Nakano. When the class arrangements are announced, Yui, Mugi and Ritsu end up in the same class, while Mio ends up in a different class with Nodoka. The group puts up with Sawako's ideas of promoting the club by dressing them up as animals, even though it seems to be having the opposite effect. Ui and her classmate, Jun Suzuki, visit the club only to find everyone dressed as maids, but the girls soon change into tracksuits after finding it impossible to play while wearing the maid outfits. Meanwhile, Azusa walks around looking for a club that is right for her, initially passing up the light music club because they don't seem serious. The light music club gets ready for another live performance at the Freshman Welcome assembly, but Mio is still too embarrassed to do the vocals, so Yui does them instead. Yui forgets about the lyrics at the beginning of a song, but Mio manages to get over her shyness and back her up. Ui brings Azusa to watch the show, and Azusa is moved so much by it that she decides to join the club.</p><br>

						<h3>"New Club Member!"</h3><br>
						<p>Azusa officially joins the club, but is shocked to find everyone drinking tea and eating cake instead of practicing. She yells at them when Sawako tells her off for actually practicing, but Yui manages to calm her down with a surprising tactic. Despite her objections, Azusa finds herself weak against Tsumugi's tea and cakes. Yui herself is rather shocked at how much better Azusa is at guitar than she is. Sawako brings a pair of cat ears for Azusa to wear, much to Azusa's discomfort, leading Yui to give her the wierd nickname 'Azu-nyan'. Noticing that Azusa is a bit upset, Mio encourages the band to practice more, but the group quickly reverts to its lazy state. Frustrated, Azusa becomes really upset since she cannot understand why the band members she admired at the live performance behave like they do. After Azusa expresses her frustration, Mio explains to her that she stays with the band because they have fun performing together and because they like each other, convincing Azusa decides to stay.</p><br>

						<h3>"Another Training Camp!"</h3><br>
						<p>Azusa and Ui hang out together for the first time for lunch, joined later by a stealthy Ritsu. Yui and Ritsu invite Sawako to join their next training camp, but she appears disinterested. The gang arrive at an even bigger villa than last year, though Tsumugi apologetically points out it still is not the "big" one she desired. Yui and Ritsu want to play and Mio and Azusa want to practice, but Tsumugi casts the deciding vote in favor of playing. Although Azusa objects, she ends up having the most fun anyway, even getting sunburned in the process. After practice, dinner, and fireworks, Ritsu suggests a test of courage, and Mio and Azusa are shocked by the sudden appearance of Sawako. In the middle of the night, Azusa discovers Yui practicing the guitar, and they bond. Azusa meets up with Ui again, saying that despite not practicing much, she enjoyed the trip as she got to know more about the group.</p><br>

						<h3>"Crisis!"</h3><br>
						<p>When Ritsu is reminded by Nodoka to fill in the stage-use application in advance, the band notices they do not have a name yet. Azusa notices rust on Yui's guitar strings, and it becomes apparent that Yui has never given her guitar maintenance before. They take it to the guitar shop, where Mio is entranced by rare left-handed guitars. After the guitar is repaired, Yui realizes that she has to pay for the maintenance service, but didn't bring any money. Tsumugi offers to pay, but the staff refuse to take money from her, telling her to consider it a free service. Later, Ritsu starts to become jealous of Mio spending time with Nodoka and begins to fall out with her. She ends up with a fever, so Mio visits and smooths things over, joined later by the other girls. Back at school, a recovered Ritsu gets in trouble for failing to turn in the application form on time, but Nodoka backs her up in front of the student council. Since the girls are unable to decide on a name for the band, Sawako makes an executive decision and assigns the name "Hokago Tea Time" to the band. Unfortunately, Yui ends up catching Ritsu's cold.</p><br>

						<h3>"Light Music!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui is still sick from her cold, which is possibly attributed to her wearing a short yukata for too long. As the band tries to make do with Azusa as lead guitarist, Yui supposedly shows up over with her cold. However, her playing is too perfect and when she accidentally messes up her honorifics, it is revealed that she is actually Ui, who had managed to play after a few days practice. Yui appears, but is still in no condition to play, so Mio tells her to stay home and recuperate until the day of the live performance. Yui eventually makes it in time, but forgets her guitar at home, so Sawako fills in for her while she goes to get it. Yui returns in time for the second song and the performance goes well, and the band even does an encore.</p><br>

Afterward, everyone goes to Yui's house to see the new year in, although only Mio and Ritsu manage to stay up until midnight. Yui wakes everyone up to see the first sunrise of the new year.</p><br>
