						<h3>"Seniors!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui and the other girls start their third year at high school (Azusa's second). Yui, Mio, Ritsu and Tsumugi are surprised that they, along with Nodoka, have been put into the same class. It soon becomes apparent that their new homeroom teacher, none other than Sawako, had arranged it that way so she had fewer names to remember. With Azusa being the only second year of the light music club, the gang become determined to get new members so that she will not be the sole member when they graduate. However, their various attempts to attract new students fail, so they focus instead on their performance for the freshman reception. Azusa becomes depressed that no new members show up afterward, but after talking with Ui and Jun and overhearing Yui's comments, she decides it is fine with just the five of them for now.</p><br>

						<h3>"Cleanup!"</h3><br>
						<p>While clearing their personal belongings out of the club room, the girls find an old guitar that used to belong to Sawako. Since it had aged a bit, Sawako allows the girls to sell it and add the money to the club's budget. After visiting a home superstore to buy a storage shelf, they take the guitar to the music store where they are surprised to find it valued at ¥500,000. When Sawako inquires about the sale, Ritsu tries lying about its value, but it backfires when Sawako asks for a receipt and the club end up getting considerably less money. However, she allows the girls to buy one thing with the money. Noticing that Azusa looks a bit concerned about not having any freshmen to look after, the girls decide to get her a pet turtle named Ton.</p><br>

						<p>After noticing how badly she shows up in videos of the band's performances, Ritsu decides she does not want to be the drummer anymore as she does not stand out enough. She tries playing the guitar but cannot get beyond the basics. She tries the keyboard next, but only goes as far as playing with all the sound effects. The next day, Yui tries coming up with various ways to make Ritsu stand out, with no such luck. Later that night, Ritsu recalls when she first started drumming and practicing every day. After watching a DVD of The Who, she realizes that even though she is not always in the spotlight, she loves playing the drums. The next day, Tsumugi shows off a new song that Ritsu helped her come up with when Ritsu is learning how to play the keyboard.</p><br>

						<h3>"Field Trip"</h3><br>
						<p>The third years go on a school field trip to Kyoto. On the train there, Mio is a little annoyed at Yui's and Ritsu's childish behavior. Mio realizes that she will have to watch over both of them during the trip. After visiting various shrines and attractions, the group returns to the inn where the girls' bad habits continue to annoy Mio as well as Sawako. The next day, they have a look around Kyoto, though Mio laments that no one wants to participate in any tourist activities. However, when they get lost on the way back to the train station along with Nodoka's group, Mio gives in to the jokey nature of the others and loosens up for the rest of the trip.</p><br>

						<h3>"Staying Behind!"</h3><br>
						<p>Azusa and Ui, along with their classmate Jun, spend time together while the third years are on their trip to Kyoto. Noticing that Ui would be lonely without her sister around, Jun and Azusa decide to sleepover at her house, in exchange for Azusa helping out with her underclassmen in the jazz club. After spending the night, they wake up to a rainy day. They go to an arcade where Ui hits a home run in a batting game, before Azusa is reminded that she needs to feed Ton. While in the music room, the three decide to have a jam session together. The other girls return the next day and give Azusa a keychain, one of a set that spells out 'light music club'.</p><br>

While Yui lets her clothes dry, she temporarily wears a maid costume made by Sawako until she gets told off about it. Azusa later helps Yui maintain her guitar. When it continues to rain the next day, the others recommend Yui keep her guitar in the clubroom overnight, though it causes her to worry late at night. The following day, Yui is so overjoyed to be reunited with her guitar that she brings it to class, but Sawako tells her to put it away.</p><br>

						<h3>"Tea Party!"</h3><br>
						<p>Mio gets the feeling that someone is watching her, making her feel uneasy, though it turns out to be because she had a sticker on her hair. She is visited by Nodoka, along with a couple of members from Mio's fan club. The girls are reminded of the previous year, where Mio felt like she was being stalked by someone and went to the student council for advice. There, she met the former student council president Megumi Sokabe, who suspiciously appeared to know a lot about her and the light music club. It was soon revealed that Megumi was not only Mio's stalker, but was also president of her fan club who had wanted to see as much of her as possible before she graduated. As a graduation gift, Mio and the girls held a private concert just for her. After Megumi graduated, she passed the position of fan club president over to Nodoka. Since she had not found time to do anything for the club, Nodoka asks the light music club to hold a special tea party for them. Mio is initially embarrassed by all the skits, interviews and service she has to put up with, but warms up when she sees a slideshow of her times with the light music club. The event ends with a performance and a group photo, which Azusa sends to Megumi.</p><br>

						<p>While filling in University Choice forms, Yui and Ritsu get in trouble for not being decisive enough about their future. Nodoka tells the others about how Yui somehow became friends with her after they met in kindergarten and how she has improved since joining the light music club. Mio and Ritsu later tell how they met and how Ritsu helped Mio when she was nervous about reading her award-winning essay in front of others in fourth grade. When Yui attempts to put 'musician' as her career choice only to be rejected, Nodoka cannot help but laugh. Yui asks her classmates for some advice, but still gets confused, so she just says she will do her best for now, which is still rejected.</p><br>

Wanting to pay her back, Yui decides to enter, though the others are concerned about her juggling two priorities. Azusa decides to join her act and help her study for finals. After their tests, Yui and Azusa perform their routine. Though they do not win, Yui gives her participation prize to the old lady as thanks. Yui manages to pass her tests with high scores.</p><br>

						<p>After Sawako gets a call on her phone from someone in the clubroom, the girls decide to follow her. They find her meeting up with one of her friends, and although they are easily noticed by her, she does not alert Sawako to their position. After Sawako leaves, her friend introduces herself to the others as Norimi, a guitarist from the previous light music club's band, Death Devil. She reveals that one of their classmates is getting married and asked Death Devil to perform at the wedding reception, but Norimi cannot convince Sawako to join up with them due to her current image. When Yui and the others are unable to convincing Sawako, Yui ends up taking the guitarist role in the band, much to Sawako's surprise. However, when Yui messes up and starts giving the band a cute image, Sawako steps up on stage to take Yui's place to show everyone what Death Devil is really about. Despite her secret shame being found out, she still remains popular with the freshmen.</p><br>

After dragging Sawako away from the air-conditioned staff room (partly to give Tsumugi a ride back to her house to get a bigger tank for Ton), the girls wonder why the club room does not have an air conditioner. After inquiring with Nodoka about it, it turns out that Ritsu never sent in a request for an air conditioner due to her never attending any student council club meetings. After pleading to the student council, the club room gets one installed. However, Yui slumps over, having forgotten that she is weak to air conditioning.</p><br>

Meanwhile, the girls shortly go separate ways to listen to different bands. While Mio gets entranced by a left-handed guitarist, Sawako enjoys headbanging to a heavy metal band far from the others. After a day of music, the girls sit under the stars, listen to the bands far away, and agree to perform at the next Summer Festival.</p><br>

At the final stretch, Yui assumes that there will not be a rice cake for the person in last place, causing everyone to make a dash for the ending, resulting in Mio, who did not want to finish last due to it being embarrassing, performing an extravagant roll upon tripping at the finish line. While everyone enjoys red bean soup and rice cakes, Sawako is still searching for Yui.</p><br>

The next morning, Sawako gives the girls special Ho-kago Tea Time t-shirts for their performance.</p><br>

						<h3>"Yet Another School Festival!"</h3><br>
						<p>The girls get on stage for their performance and are surprised to find everyone in the audience wearing the same shirts as they are, which moves Yui a lot. During their performance, they sing two new songs, and Yui gives her thanks to the people who have helped her, and even gets thanks in return from the others. After their performance, the girls look back on their previous years and start to become upset knowing that this is their last year together, but manage to cheer each other up.</p><br>

						<h3>"Yearbook!"</h3><br>
						<p>With photos for the graduation yearbook coming up, Yui uses Ui as a model to determine the best hairstyle, though feels weird when she leaves her hairpin on her. Although the seniors have finished their clubs, the girls decide to use the music room to study for their entrance exams, though Yui and Ritsu still have yet to decide on their university choices. While trying to trim her bangs for her yearbook photo, Yui sneezes and accidentally cuts them off, giving her a completely different look. After their pictures are taken, the girls learn Mio had turned down a recommendation for a university because she wanted to study together with everyone. Upon hearing this, Yui, Ritsu and Mio turn in their university preference applications to Sawako, opting to go to the same women's university as Tsumugi.</p><br>

						<p>As the seniors prepare for their entrance exams, Azusa decides to make them a chocolate cake for Valentine's Day, getting Ui and Jun to help. When the day comes, Azusa becomes nervous about presenting the cake to them and is also worried about their impending graduation. However, her friends encourage her and the cake is well received, even getting a speedy White Day gift from Yui. The next day, Azusa makes an expensive prayer at the shrine for the girls' success, and later receives word that they have all passed their entrance exams.</p><br>

						<p>Although they are not supposed to be at school until graduation the next day, Yui and the others decide to hang around the club room, though they have trouble figuring out how to pass the time. They clear out their desks and visit the student council room before getting Azusa to buy them some lunch. Wanting to leave something behind after they graduate, the girls decide to record an album of their songs.</p><br>

						<h3>"Graduation Ceremony!"</h3><br>
						<p>On the day of the girls' graduation, Yui gets off to a rough start by being late and ripping her tights. Meanwhile, Azusa is similarly distracted and ends up banging her head. The girls hold on to a card signed by the entire class, though Yui's attempts to hide it during the graduation ceremony cause Sawako to grow suspicious. They later give Sawako the present as thanks for being their teacher. After the classroom empties, leaving behind several goodbye messages on a chalkboard for Sawako, the girls go to the light music room, shortly followed by Azusa. Azusa, who had been holding in her feelings all day, finally breaks down into tears, begging them not to graduate. To cheer her up, the girls perform a special song they wrote just for her.</p><br>

						<h3>"Planning Discussion!"</h3><br>
						<p>Set just after episode 21, Azusa finds the light music club's attempted recruitment video from before she joined the club, which was so embarrassing that Mio hid it in a cookie can. In order to recruit some new members for the next year, the girls try to come up with pitches for a new recruitment video, but to no avail. After talking with Ui and Jun, Azusa comes up with the idea of filming a documentary of their activities, intersected with interviews from fellow students and staff. The video turns out great, besides one scene at the end which Azusa is not too keen on.</p><br>

						<h3>"Visit!"</h3><br>
						<p>Set before episode 23, Nodoka arrives in the clubroom with a sample of the graduation yearbook. The yearbook needs to be checked by Sawako, who is sick with a cold. Curious about what her apartment looks like, the girls decide to pay her a visit. While looking through the album, they find a mysterious hand in the group photo, which turns out to be Ritsu's. Despite Sawako's objection, the girls decide to help her out around the apartment. They briefly visit Azusa, who is busy rehearsing for her freshman reception with Ui and Jun.</p><br>
